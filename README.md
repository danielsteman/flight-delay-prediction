# flight-delay-prediction

Flight delay prediction data engineering experiment.

## Plan of approach

### Extract

- [x] Extract flight data through the [Schiphol PublicFlight API](https://developer.schiphol.nl/apis/flight-api/v4/flights?version=latest)
- [x] Store in Google storage bucket

### Transform

- [ ] Load from Google storage bucket
- [ ] Find relevant features to predict flight delay
- [ ] Store in Google storage bucket

### Machine learning

- [ ] Load train set from Google storage bucket
- [ ] Train a simple model that predicts flight delay
- [ ] Serialize and store model in Google storage bucket
- [ ] Run inference service

### Authentication

In development, you might want to add these [Schiphol PublicFlight API](https://developer.schiphol.nl/apis/flight-api/v4/flights?version=latest) credentials to `.env`. They also exist as Github secrets.

```
API_KEY
API_ID
```

The application uses a Google Storage Bucket and authenticates with a service account. Credentials are expected in .gcp-credentials/credentials.json.

### Data models

`pydantic` models are generated with `datamodel-codegen` based on the OpenAPI Swagger doc provided by Schiphol PublicFlight API. `datamodel-codegen` can parse json directly through the download link of the [Swagger document](https://swagger.io/specification/).

```
datamodel-codegen --target-python-version 3.10 --url "https://developer.schiphol.nl/swagger/spec/public-flights-v4.json" --output models.py --use-title-as-name
```

Because we don't need all models, it's also possible to extract a part of the definition, safe it as a Python dict (`data/flight.py` e.g.) and parse that to generate models.

```
datamodel-codegen --input-file-type dict --output models.py --target-python-version 3.10 --input data/flight.py
```

I like using code generation tools for schemas because it's a less error prone method than doing it manually.

Install dependencies and `pre-commit` hooks, otherwise the CI will complain to you ðŸ˜¤.
